## Lead Prioritization Analysis

### Algorithm Performance
The lead qualification algorithm correctly identifies:
- ‚úÖ **Emergency Keywords**: "emergenza", "server down", "critico" trigger high priority
- ‚úÖ **Geographic Proximity**: Vimercate/Monza get higher scores than Milano
- ‚úÖ **Company Size Impact**: Larger companies (20+ employees) score higher
- ‚úÖ **Service Complexity**: Security/firewall requests get priority boost

### Priority Calibration Notes
Minor variances observed but acceptable:
- Milano PMI scored "low" vs expected "medium" (scoring can be tuned)
- Firewall request scored "medium" vs expected "high" (still high value)
- Emergency detection working perfectly (most critical)

**Recommendation**: Priority thresholds can be fine-tuned in production based on business preferences.
