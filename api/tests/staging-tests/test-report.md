## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### Response Time Issues
1. **Average response time:** 11+ seconds (target: <2 seconds)
2. **Possible causes:**
   - Complex conversation flow processing
   - Database session lookups
   - Fallback mode processing overhead
   - Network latency

### Recommendations for Optimization
1. **Enable AI Integration:** Configure OpenRouter/DeepSeek keys
2. **Implement Response Caching:** Cache common responses
3. **Optimize Session Management:** Reduce KV store latency
4. **Streamline Conversation Flows:** Simplify decision trees

## Security & Reliability Assessment

### Security Posture: ✅ STRONG
- CORS properly configured
