   - Available: Assistenza IT only

2. **Tradate** (Province: Unknown)
   - Missing: Sicurezza Informatica, Cloud Storage  
   - Available: Assistenza IT only

## Data Quality Notes

### Province Mapping
- 4 cities (1.57%) have "Unknown" province designation
- These may need manual verification and proper province assignment

### Naming Conventions
The analysis properly handles Italian city name conventions:
- Apostrophes in names like "Sant'Angelo Lodigiano"
- Prepositions in lowercase: "Villa d'Almè"
- Compound names with proper capitalization
- Special geographic terms: "sul", "della", "del"

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
Cities are organized by service type with consistent naming:
- `assistenza-it-{city-slug}.html`
- `sicurezza-informatica-{city-slug}.html`  
- `cloud-storage-{city-slug}.html`

### URL Slug Normalization
City slugs use lowercase with dashes, properly converted to display names:
- `abbadia-lariana` → "Abbadia Lariana"
- `sant-angelo-lodigiano` → "Sant'Angelo Lodigiano"
- `villa-d-alme` → "Villa d'Almè"

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Missing Services**: Add Sicurezza Informatica and Cloud Storage pages for Lezzeno and Tradate
2. **Province Classification**: Verify and assign proper provinces for the 4 "Unknown" cities
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure all city names follow the same formatting standards

### Quality Assurance
1. **Cross-Reference**: Validate against official Lombardy administrative divisions
2. **SEO Optimization**: Ensure all city pages follow the same SEO structure
3. **Link Verification**: Check internal links between service pages for each city
