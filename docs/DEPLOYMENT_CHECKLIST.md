# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "resilience": {
    "initialized": true,
    "systemHealth": "HEALTHY",
    "degradationLevel": "FULL"
  }
}
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production

# Immediate post-deployment checks
curl https://your-chatbot-prod.workers.dev/health
curl https://your-chatbot-prod.workers.dev/analytics
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerting for health check failures
- [ ] Monitor circuit breaker states
- [ ] Track error rates and response times
- [ ] Verify fallback system usage
- [ ] Check emergency detection accuracy

## Monitoring & Alerting Setup

### Critical Alerts (PagerDuty/Slack)
- Health endpoint DOWN for >2 minutes
- Circuit breakers OPEN for >5 minutes
- Error rate >5% for >10 minutes
- Emergency detection failures
- Complete system failures

### Performance Alerts (Email/Teams)
- Response time >3 seconds average
- Memory usage >80%
- High retry exhaustion rate
- Degradation level changes

### Daily Reports
- System uptime summary
- Circuit breaker statistics
- Retry handler performance
- Fallback system usage
- Error pattern analysis

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback

# Verify rollback successful
curl https://your-chatbot-prod.workers.dev/health
```

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical test failures in production
- Health endpoint returning errors
- >10% error rate sustained
- Complete chat functionality failure
- Security incidents detected

## Success Criteria

### System Performance
- âœ… 99.99% uptime (52 minutes/year downtime)
- âœ… <3 seconds response time (95th percentile)
- âœ… <0.1% error rate
- âœ… <30 seconds recovery time

### User Experience
- âœ… No visible system errors
- âœ… Seamless fallback transitions
- âœ… Emergency responses <150ms
- âœ… 100% successful escalations

### Operational Metrics
- âœ… <2% false alerts
- âœ… <1% manual interventions
- âœ… >98% automatic recovery
- âœ… <5% resilience overhead

## Architecture Validation

### File Structure Check
