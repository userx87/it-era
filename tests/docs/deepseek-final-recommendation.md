### Secondary Recommendation: **ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION**

If implementation risks are deemed too high:
1. **Monitor market developments** for latency improvements
2. **Evaluate other cost-effective models** (Claude Haiku, other alternatives)
3. **Consider DeepSeek for internal tools only** (documentation, analysis)
4. **Reassess in 6 months** when technology may be more mature

### Not Recommended: **FULL REPLACEMENT**

Complete migration from GPT-4o Mini to DeepSeek is not advisable given:
- Critical latency limitations for customer service
- Unknown Italian language performance
- Security and compliance concerns
- Reliability inconsistencies

## Conclusion

DeepSeek offers compelling technical capabilities and cost savings, but significant operational limitations prevent it from serving as a complete replacement for GPT-4o Mini in IT-ERA's customer service environment.

A carefully implemented hybrid strategy can capture cost benefits while maintaining service quality, but success depends on strict adherence to use case boundaries and continuous quality monitoring.

The recommendation is to proceed with limited testing and gradual implementation, with full readiness to rollback if quality or customer satisfaction metrics decline.

**Bottom Line**: DeepSeek can be a valuable supplement to GPT-4o Mini for specific technical tasks, but cannot replace it for core customer service functions in the Italian market.
