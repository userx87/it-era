## Test Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Baseline Testing
1. Run all 5 scenarios with both models
2. Measure response times and token usage
3. Evaluate response quality blindly (without knowing model)
4. Document specific strengths/weaknesses

### Week 2: Consistency Testing
1. Run same queries 5 times each with both models
2. Measure response variation
3. Test different phrasings of same question
4. Evaluate reliability over time

### Week 3: A/B Testing Setup
1. Implement routing logic for live testing
2. Start with Scenario 5 (technical analysis) only
3. Monitor customer satisfaction scores
4. Track resolution rates and follow-up questions

### Week 4: Analysis and Reporting
1. Compile comprehensive performance comparison
2. Calculate true cost-benefit analysis
3. Identify optimal use cases for each model
4. Create recommendations for production deployment
