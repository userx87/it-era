```
Client Inquiry ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí Lead Scoring ‚Üí Escalation (if needed)
```

The chatbot operates on three response levels:
1. **Rule-based responses** for simple, common questions
2. **AI-powered responses** for complex or nuanced inquiries  
3. **Human escalation** for technical complexity or explicit requests

#### When You'll Be Notified

**Automatic Escalation Triggers:**
- Client mentions "preventivo" (quote request)
- Emergency keywords detected ("URGENTE", "production down")
- High-complexity technical questions
- Explicit request to speak with human
- Lead score >80/100 (high-value prospect)

**Notification Methods:**
- Microsoft Teams message with client context
- Lead priority classification (Low/Medium/High)
- Complete conversation history included
- Suggested specialist assignment

### Handling Escalated Conversations

#### Step 1: Review the Context
When you receive a Teams notification:
```
üö® HIGH PRIORITY LEAD - Score: 92/100

Client: Dott.ssa Laura Bianchi
Company: Centro Medico Brianza  
Sector: Healthcare
Budget Range: ‚Ç¨25,000-30,000
Urgency: High (GDPR compliance needed)

Key Requirements:
- GDPR-compliant IT infrastructure
- Healthcare data security
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Timeline: 2-3 months

Conversation Summary: [Full chat history]
Recommended Specialist: Privacy Officer + CTO
```

#### Step 2: Prepare for Contact
- Review the **full conversation history** provided
- Note the **lead score** and **priority level**
- Check **client's specific requirements** and concerns
- Identify the **appropriate specialist** for assignment

#### Step 3: Follow Up Appropriately
**High Priority (Score >80):** Contact within 2 hours
**Medium Priority (Score 50-80):** Contact within 24 hours  
**Low Priority (Score <50):** Contact within 48 hours

#### Step 4: Use the Context
Reference the chatbot conversation:
> "Hi Dott.ssa Bianchi, I saw from our initial conversation that you're looking for GDPR-compliant solutions for your medical center. I'd like to discuss how we can help with your specific requirements..."

### Managing the System

Access the admin dashboard at: `[Admin URL to be provided]`

**Key Metrics to Watch:**

#### Common Scenarios & Responses

**Scenario 1: Technical Question Beyond Chatbot Knowledge**
```
Client: "Can you explain your Kubernetes migration methodology?"

         specialist's detailed expertise. Let me connect you with our 
         Solution Architect who can walk you through our specific 
         Kubernetes migration process."
Action: Escalation to Technical Team
```

**Scenario 2: Pricing Inquiry**
```
Client: "How much does your cybersecurity audit cost?"
Chatbot: "Our cybersecurity audit pricing varies based on your infrastructure 
         size and compliance requirements. To provide an accurate quote, 
         I'll need to understand your specific environment better."
Action: Lead qualification questions, then escalation
```

**Scenario 3: Emergency Support**
```
Client: "URGENT - our email server is down!"
Chatbot: "I understand this is urgent. I'm immediately connecting you 
         with our emergency support team who will contact you within 
         15 minutes at [phone number from conversation]."
Action: Immediate escalation with HIGH PRIORITY flag
```

         for your accounting firm. IT support for professional services is 
         one of our specialties, especially with the compliance requirements 
         in your sector.

         To recommend the best solution, could you tell me:
         1. What specific IT challenges are you currently facing?
         2. Do you have any compliance requirements (tax data security, etc.)?
         3. Are you looking for proactive monitoring or mainly break-fix support?"

Client: "We need proactive monitoring and backup solutions. We handle sensitive 
        client tax data."

Chatbot: "Perfect. For tax professionals handling sensitive data, we recommend 
         our Professional Services IT package which includes:
         
         ‚úÖ 24/7 proactive monitoring
         ‚úÖ Secure, compliant backup solutions

         ‚úÖ Compliance reporting and documentation
         
         This typically runs ‚Ç¨800-1,200/month for an 8-person firm. Would you 
         like me to connect you with our specialist who can provide a detailed 
         proposal based on your specific setup?"
```

#### Enterprise Security Audit
```
Client: "We're a manufacturing company that needs a comprehensive cybersecurity 
        audit for ISO 27001 compliance"

Chatbot: "Excellent timing - cybersecurity compliance is critical in manufacturing, 
         especially with increasing IoT integration and supply chain requirements.
         
         Our ISO 27001 cybersecurity audits are comprehensive and include:
         ‚úÖ Full infrastructure assessment
         ‚úÖ Policy and procedure review
         ‚úÖ Employee security training evaluation
         ‚úÖ Compliance gap analysis and remediation plan
         
         For manufacturing environments, we also assess:
         - Industrial control system security
         - Network segmentation between IT/OT
         - Supply chain vulnerability assessment
         
         Could you tell me more about:
         1. Your current manufacturing systems and connectivity?
         2. Timeline for ISO 27001 certification?
         3. Size of your organization and infrastructure scope?"

Client: "We have 50 employees, mixed IT/OT environment, and need certification 
        within 6 months"

Chatbot: "That's definitely achievable. For a 50-employee manufacturing environment 
         with IT/OT integration, this is typically a 3-4 month project with 
         investment around ‚Ç¨25,000-35,000.
         
         Given the complexity and timeline, I'd like to connect you immediately 
         with our ISO 27001 Specialist and Security Architect. They can:
         - Conduct a preliminary assessment this week
         - Provide detailed project timeline and costs
